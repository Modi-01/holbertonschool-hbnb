# HBnB Project

## Overview
**HBnB project** is a simplified, AirBnB-like application designed to teach Holberton students how to build web applications end-to-end, from the back end to the front end. The project is divided into four main parts, each part focuses on a distinct set of skills and a core component of full-stack development.
