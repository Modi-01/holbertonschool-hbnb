# HBnB Project

## Overview
**HBnB project** is a simplified, AirBnB-like application designed to teach Holberton students how to build web applications end-to-end, from the back end to the front end. The project is divided into four main parts, each part focuses on a distinct set of skills and a core component of full-stack development.

## Part 1 — Technical Documentation
This part provides a structured blueprint of the system before implementation. The goal is to establish a shared understanding of the system’s design, responsibilities, and interactions across layers—making later development phases clearer, faster, and less error-prone.
